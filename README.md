# What is this?
Windows Frameless Terminal or simply WFT is an application that allows user to replicate Linux terminal experience. As a preview of version (1.0), it allows users dragging the window by using a custom set key in the configuration file.

# Why?
You might want your terminal to looking better without a titlebar.

# Preview
